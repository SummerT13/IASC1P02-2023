        I am a second year student in the Interactive Arts and Science Program. I live in Niagara Falls, Ontario. I am in the IASC program becuase I want
        to pursue a career in grapghic or web design. My passion for design and technology came from a communications technology and yearbook class that
        I took in highschool. My highschool to univeristy transition was very smooth. I live at home and commute to campus, making my life a little more easy
        and stress free. I have moved around alot in my 19 years. I have lived innisfil, Barrie, Burlington, and Niagara. I really love living here because
        it is a mix of btoh country and city living. I have made a good amount of friends from all over and am greatful to have had that experince.I currently
        do not have a job during the school year, but I am activley looking. In the summer I work at a winery in Niagara on the lake as a host.

        I have been a cheerleader for the last 14 years. I have done all star, highschool, and now varsity cheer. I am a cheerleader at Brock Univeristy and
        this is my second year on the team. All star cheer is by far my faviorite. It is more fast paced and complex. There are 7 levels in the sport. I was
        level 5 in all star, levl 3 in high school, and level 7 at Brock. I am also in a sosority called Alpha Pi Phi. My love for philanthrophy and fundraising
        for good causes drove me to apply and become an initiated sister. I also have an admire for going on hikes and traveling with my family.
